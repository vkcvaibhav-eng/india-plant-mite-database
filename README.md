# india-plant-mite-database

Literature-derived records of plant-associated mites in India: which species is recorded from which state and on which host plant, each row traced to its printed source.

This is the data repository for Paper 2 of the project *Agricultural mites in India*. Paper 1 (COI coverage and name reliability) lives in [india-agri-mite-coi](https://github.com/vkcvaibhav-eng/india-agri-mite-coi); its species checklist is the name backbone used here.

## Status (11 November 2026)

First layer only: Gupta & Mondal (2023), *Handbook: Plant Mites of India* (literature up to 2022), 1,249 numbered accounts. All rows are machine-parsed from an OCR transcription and have not yet been checked against the printed page.

| Measure | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Accounts | 1,249 |
| Accounts linked to a checklist species | 1,088 |
| Species × state records | 1,966 |
| States and union territories | 31 |
| Species × host records | 1,588 |
| Distinct host names | 918 |
| Host text not parsed (review queue) | 117 |
| Locality text not matched to a state (review queue) | 46 |
| Accounts with no host text | 404 |

The 161 unlinked accounts are the 150 accounts of predatory families other than Phytoseiidae, which the Paper 1 checklist does not cover, and 11 genus-level `sp.`/`spp.` accounts.

## Files

- `data/records/species_state.csv`: one row per species and Indian state.
- `data/records/species_host.csv`: one row per species and host. `host_as_printed` keeps the source text; `host_rank` is `species`, `genus`, `common_name`, `species_genus_expanded` or `undetermined_plant`; `in_india` is 0 for hosts the book lists as recorded outside India.
- `data/records/summary.csv`: the counts above.
- `data/review/`: text the parser could not place. Nothing in these files is in the records.
- `data/raw/`: source files copied from the checklist repository at the commit pinned in `config/sources.json`.

## Rebuild

```bash
python scripts/fetch_sources.py
python scripts/build_records.py
```

Python standard library only.

## Limits

- Host names are as printed. Plant names have not been checked against a plant-name authority, so spelling variants and synonyms of one plant are still separate rows.
- The book prints hosts for phytophagous mites and habitats for most predatory mites. Habitat plants are not in this layer.
- State names follow the book (for example Orissa, Pondicherry). Records dated before state reorganisations are not reassigned.
- Records carry the book as their source, not the original paper behind each record.
